# First-HTML


These are the HTML and CSS files from my first (in a long time) HTML project. I took an HTML course by Dave Grey, which can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJgBOIoGihA

The files here contain the code I used to create a locally working website that contained different elements such as photos, forms, lists, buttons, links, and a little use of CSS to tie some elements together.
