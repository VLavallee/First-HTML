    <h1>About the page developer</h1>
    <p>
        Victor was born in Manitoba, Canada and has been involved in the
        technology field since a young age. In elementary school he took his first computer
        classes, including web development in grade 6. In high school he continued his learning by taking his first
        steps in computer animation, AutoCAD, and music production. As an adult he worked in the field of oil and gas as
        a machinist, before transitioning into a developer during the 2020 pandemic. Initially focusing on computer game
        development he now seeks to broaden his understanding of the field by learning web, mobile, and desktop
        development.

        electronic music using computer DAWs and hardware synthesizers.
